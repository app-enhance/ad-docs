# **Welcome to App-Enhance's documentation!**

[App-Enhance](https://github.com/app-enhance) is a set of boilerplate/extensions libraries for any .Net application. All code is based on
[.Net Core](https/dot.net) and .NETStandard Library 1.5. It tries to cover and simplify many common use cases which you can encounter when you create
real applications. They are dependency injection, events, messaging, transactions and persistence.

Please follow navigation co read documentation.
